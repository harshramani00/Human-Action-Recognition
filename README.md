# Swift-Spatio Flow: A Human Action Recognition Model Using 3D CNN-LSTM

## üìå Project Overview

**Swift-Spatio Flow** is an advanced **Human Action Recognition (HAR)** model that combines **3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN)** with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks. This project aims to improve action recognition in videos by efficiently extracting **spatial and temporal features** while reducing computational cost.

üöÄ **Key Applications**
- CCTV surveillance enhancement
- Assisting the visually impaired
- Self-driving cars
- Sports analytics

## üéØ Problem Statement
Existing HAR models suffer from:
- **Complexity:** High computational cost
- **Accuracy:** Difficulty in handling low-quality videos
- **Scalability:** Struggle with large datasets

**Swift-Spatio Flow** addresses these challenges by integrating a **3D CNN and LSTM** to extract spatial and temporal features efficiently.

## üìä Methodology
1. **Preprocessing:** 
   - Extract frames from videos
   - Resize and normalize images
   - Convert frames into sequences

2. **Model Architecture:** 
   - 3D CNN for feature extraction
   - LSTM for sequence modeling
   - Softmax activation for classification

3. **Training & Evaluation:**
   - Dataset: **UCF-50**
   - Metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**
   - Comparison with existing models
